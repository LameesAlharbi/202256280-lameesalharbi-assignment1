## Project Overview

This is a responsive personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It is designed to present personal information, projects, and contact details in a structured and accessible format.

## Social Media Integration

Social media links were added to allow visitors to access my professional profiles directly.
Clickable icons are used instead of text links to improve visual clarity and user experience.
Each icon is wrapped inside an anchor tag (`<a>`) that links to the external profile.
Example implementation:

```html
<a href="https://github.com/LameesAlharbi" target="_blank">
  <img src="assets/images/github.png" alt="GitHub">
</a>
