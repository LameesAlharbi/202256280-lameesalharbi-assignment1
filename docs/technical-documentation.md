This is a responsive personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It is designed to present personal information, projects, and contact details in a structured and accessible format.

## Social Media Integration

Social media links were added to allow visitors to access my professional profiles directly.
Clickable icons are used instead of text links to improve visual clarity and user experience.
Each icon is wrapped inside an anchor tag (`<a>`) that links to the external profile.
Example implementation:

<a href="https://github.com/LameesAlharbi" target="_blank">
  <img src="assets/images/github.png" alt="GitHub">
</a>

## Responsive Design Testing

The portfolio website was designed using CSS Flexbox and Grid to ensure proper layout across different screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Responsive behavior was tested using browser developer tools by simulating various screen sizes. The layout automatically adjusts by stacking elements vertically and resizing images and text to maintain readability and usability.

The screenshot below demonstrates the mobile view of the website at a screen width of 375px, confirming that the design adapts correctly for smartphone displays.
